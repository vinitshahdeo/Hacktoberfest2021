- About:  Hi, I am Drishti. I am a third-year undergrad student at IIT Madras. I have a great zeal for programming, and I am always excited about solving challenges and working on real-world problems. Likewise, I am skilled with C++, Python, and JavaScript and have worked with various tech frameworks. I am a self-dedicated person and always excited to learn and explore new things. Apart from this, I love to dance and read books, they are a great tool for refreshing my mind.

### Why do you want to become a mentor (optional)
Mentorship has helped me a lot in my tech journey. I understand that the tech space can sometimes be really overwhelming in the beginning, I have also been through the same space and been confused about how to start with things and what is important and guidance from my mentors has always helped me. Being a part of this program will give me  
a chance to give back to the community in some way and I would love to share my knowledge and learnings with others.
